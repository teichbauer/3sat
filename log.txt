In this project I will find a way to find sats.
Tentatively using value-block transfer. That means, ...

gen now takes multiple knames, like
  python C001 C002 C003
This will first do C001, then tx(C002) and do output, then based on tx(C002),
do tx(C003).
I hope to find a way, when doing tx(C002), cut off C001's lst's last section
covered by C001, and then in C002's output, cutt off last section covered by
C002. If that can be done, by the time of doing C003, the space would be 
reduced. And the first s line with out being covered by C003, will be the
targeted sats.
But I am yet not sure how to do this. NBut keep thinking.

cmd line:
python gen.py C001 C002 C003 C004 C005 C006 C007 C008 C009 C010 C011 C012
output will be 12 blocks of data:
- (64)cover-lines for the original 12 klause-set: S1
- (64)cover-lines for Tx(C002): S1  -> S2 : transformed 12 klause-set
- (64)cover-lines for Tx(C003): S2  -> S3 : transformed 12 klause-set
- (64)cover-lines for Tx(C004): S3  -> S4 : transformed 12 klause-set
- (64)cover-lines for Tx(C005): S4  -> S5 : transformed 12 klause-set
- (64)cover-lines for Tx(C006): S5  -> S6 : transformed 12 klause-set
- (64)cover-lines for Tx(C007): S6  -> S7 : transformed 12 klause-set
- (64)cover-lines for Tx(C008): S7  -> S8 : transformed 12 klause-set
- (64)cover-lines for Tx(C009): S8  -> S9 : transformed 12 klause-set
- (64)cover-lines for Tx(C010): S9  -> S10 : transformed 12 klause-set
- (64)cover-lines for Tx(C011): S10 -> S11 : transformed 12 klause-set
- (64)cover-lines for Tx(C012): S11 -> S12 : transformed 12 klause-set
----------------------------------------------------------------------
in each of the 12 data-blocks, the last 8 lines are 
covered by base-klause
It seems that the txs bring much advantage for figuring out the IF:
Even without tx, or just do tx once, I could use solver1's approach to calculate
how many UNSATs exit, by that I can know if sats > 0.
But if I know there exist sta-value(s), how do I fetch them?

---------------------
I have not yet figure out a way, how to utilize the benefit after a Tx, that the
base klause's coverage block always lies at the last/bottom lines.
But, I am thinking of using the bit-block pattern, to count from v==0 line
downwards...
First, if I know there does exist at least 1 sat, I could use bit-block of the
klauses, to move down from value==0, value == 1,... or block-wise, which would
jump, not move, that could do the trick of not being O(2‚Åø).

Or, Could a do the txs with the bottom block cut off, to condense the 
cover-lines to the bottom, so that the sat(s) lines will be on the top - then
just pick the first K lines (suppose there exist K sats). That wold be nice!
