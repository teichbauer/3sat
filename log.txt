In this project I will find a way to find sats.
Tentatively using value-block transfer. Tht means, ...

gen now takes multiple knames, like
  python C001 C002 C003
This will first do C001, then tx(C002) and do output, then based on tx(C002),
do tx(C003).
I hope to find a way, when doing tx(C002), cut off C001's lst's last section
covered by C001, and then in C002's output, cutt off last section covered by
C002. If that can be done, by the time of doing C003, the space would be 
reduced. And the first s line with out being covered by C003, will be the
targeted sats.
But I am yet not sure how to do this. NBut keep thinking.
